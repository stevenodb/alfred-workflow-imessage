# alfred-workflow-imessage
Alfred plugin for buddy completion from iMessage app

This plugin is keyword triggered and will use your (partial) input argument to match iMessage buddies from the Messages app. The script will match on buddy properties such as firstname, lastname, full name, handle. The matched buddies are shown in a list. Selecting one will open the Messages app with his/her conversation window active.

## limitations
1. The Messages app only provides a list of recent imessage buddies.
2. Including contacts from the Contact apps slowed down the script too much.
